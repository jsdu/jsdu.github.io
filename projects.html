				<p>Ultimate TicTacToe Ten is an iOS app that I made when I wanted to learn how to use Swift. It is my first app released on the App Store.

				<p>One Word is an iOS app made during ConUHacks 2016. I led a team of three to create and build a fully functioning social media app for photographers. The idea of this app is to send one word to everyone everyday. They must take a picture related to the word and users can vote on the best picture. We believe that this will help connect photographers and bring out the creative side to everyone. Users are able to see a collection of the best pictures for each word taken on the homepage. We used Parse for registration and secure logins. We also used Clarifai's Api to score the picture based on relevancy. Clarifai's Api sends us tags related the picture which we match with the word of the day. While building this app, I learnt how to use UICollectionViews to display the images in a grid.</p>

			<h3>WeLink</h3>
			<p>Social media app for meeting strangers</p>
		</header>
		<p>WeLink is an iOS App made during Hack the North 2015. I led a team of four to design and create this app in 48 hours. The purpose of this app is to connect people with others around them. Users provide their interest and hobbies when they sign up, creating an online public profile that other WeLink users will see. Users are able to message and send selfies to each other and will gain points based on how "happy" they were. I used Cocoa Pods to integrate the Facebook API for secure logins. I used <a id="link" href="https://indico.io">Indico's</a> REST API to analyze the emotions of the selfies taken. </p>

			<h3>Latex My Notes</h3>
			<p>Turn pictures into latex</p>
		</header>
		<p>Latex My Notes is an iOS app made during MHacks 2015. The idea for this app was to be able to transform written notes into Latex PDFs. The difficulties that we faced was that there was no OCR Api that was capable to lift text off of hand written notes. The best Api that we found and implemented was Google's tesseract. I implemented the camera functionality of the app, as well as sending the pictures taken to our server. Our server was hosted on Firebase where we lifted the text off the picture and processed them into Latex PDF documents.</p>

			<h3>Safe.ly</h3>
			<p>Safe Driving, No Sleepy Driving</p>
		</header>
		<p>Safe.ly is an Android app made during Wearhacks Montreal 2015. Safe.ly connects to a Muse headset and is used by a drive to analyzes their brain waves. Safe.ly sends notifications whenever the user starts to fall asleep. We used Muse's <a id="link" href="http://developer.choosemuse.com/android">Api</a> to analyze head movement and brain waves. We then send notifications at the optimal time to alert the driver. We placed top 8 overall and received the best hack on the Muse. As a result we received a free Muse Headset to hack on. BCI Montreal wrote an article about this hackathon where our app was featured which you can find <a id="link" href="http://bcimontreal.org/bci-hackathon/">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Loblawfy</h3>
			<p>Replace all pictures with Loblaw-related pictures</p>
		</header>
		<p>Loblawfy is a Chrome extension made during Loblaw's hackathon. I had no prior experience with Javascript so building this extension helped me understand Javascript. Loblawfy replaces all images with pictures related to Loblaws. It also replaces key words such as 'Walmart', or 'Sobeys' with 'Loblaws'. It also changes any link that points to Walmart, with a link that goes to the homepage of Loblaws. Finally, a beautiful animated background of Loblaws runs in the background. This chrome extension is for the truly dedicated Loblaws employee, who wishes to show their love and dedication of Loblaws in their browser. </p>
