		<p>Brapp is a free and easy way to create and discover exciting musical collaborations all over the world. Producers can share their beats allowing anyone to make mini music videos right on their phone complete with video filters and custom audio balancing.</p>
		<p>I worked with Brapp throughout 2015 as the sole iOS developer working closely with the app creator and his API developer. I was able to write the app in Swift and use AutoLayout to make sure everything scales beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone. In addition, I made use of GPUImage for the custom video filters and a whole load of low-level audio APIs to get the audio balance just right as well as real time waveforms and switching between external microphones. The design went through a number of iterations, each better than the last, and I was able to use my extensive UX knowledge to help shape the end result.</p>

			<p>A display stand app that controls audio, video, and a weather chamber</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/glenfiddich-app.jpg" width="940" height="627" alt="Glenfiddich for iPad">
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.verb.digital">Verb Digital</a> in spring 2015 as the sole iOS developer to develop a unique app for Glenfiddich. The app is part of a large installation to showcase a limited edition of Glenfiddich which is available exclusively at Changhi Airport. The single cask that has been selected by Glenfiddich is on display within a specially constructed glass chamber that showcases the weather and atmospheric conditions of the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. The iPad app allows for customers to see the current conditions in Dufftown including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and the time. This is paired with multiple sound effects which match with the weather conditions. The app also talks with a control PC via a direct socket connection over WiFi in order to control the weather effects within the chamber simulating morning fog, wind, and even rain!</p>
		<p>The app is written entirely in Swift 1.2 and the iPad is locked down with Guided Access to prevent customers accessing anything else. You can see the app at the Glenfiddich Residence store in Changhi Airport for the duration of 2015.</p>
