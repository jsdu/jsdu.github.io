		<p>The majority of my work has been in Swift 2.0. I am also familiar with Objective-C and Java. Here is a list of my personal projects as well as projects I have done in Hackathons.</p>

		<p>Once the Apple TV app was finished, the client was so pleased that they asked me to rebuild their universal iPhone and iPad app. In early 2016, I rebuilt their app from scratch (with Swift 2.1) with a number of new features such as an alarm clock, sleep timer, video backgrounds, skip track, favourites, and the ability to stream to a Chromecast. I did all of the design work myself and mimicked the Apple TV app I designed putting emphasis on blurred backgrounds based on the channel artwork. There is full support for AutoLayout with the app working in an incredible 20 different sizes and orientations including landscape iPhone and split-screen modes on the iPad. I also added support for 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s with quick access to your most recently listened channels.</p>
		<p>I'm incredibly pleased with both of these apps and have been using them regularly; Calm Radio for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV is free but some features are limited to paid accounts available from <a href="https://calmradio.com/">calmradio.com</a>.</p>
		<p>You can read more about the <a href="/weblog/2016/01/13/calm-radio-for-apple-tv/">Apple TV development</a> and <a href="/weblog/2016/02/02/calm-radio-for-ios/">iOS development</a> of the apps on my blog.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 0.8em"><em>(Please note the link above will take you to the iOS version of the app - you'll need to search "Calm Radio" on the Apple TV App Store in order to download that version)</em></p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.munchkinreport.com">Munchkin Report</a> at the end of 2015 to develop their first app for their new online service. Munchkin Report helps you track your child's moments, big and small. From her first steps to yesterday's nap schedule, Munchkin Report captures memories, keeps parents and caregivers in-sync, and helps you make informed decisions.</p>
		<p>As the sole iOS developer on the project, I worked closely with the client and API developer of the project in order to bring their vision to life. From API documentation and a basic outline, I had freedom to create the minimalist design and UX that makes Munchkin Report a fast and simple app to use. I made tweaks and changes to the original UX and added additional features such as 3D touch quick actions and "Peek and Pop" throughout the app.</p>
		<p>I'm really pleased with the way this app turned out and I think it'll be a great resource for childcarers and parents. Munchkin Report is free but does require an account from <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">munchkinreport.com</a> (free trials are available).</p>
		<p>You can <a href="/weblog/2016/01/13/munchkin-report/">read more about the development</a> of the app and see some photos of it in action on my blog.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/">Natural Cycles</a> at the end of 2015 to help add an Apple Watch app to the new version of their popular iPhone app. The watchOS app syncs with the iOS app in order to show critical information relating to the fertility tracking and pregnancy planning features as well as reading through received messages. In addition to displaying information, you can also log your current body temperature and menstrual flow from the Apple Watch. To complement the app, I also built in support for Glances, Notifications, and Complications so you can view your information in a multitude of different ways.</p>
		<p>I was the sole Swift developer on the project and had complete control over the Apple Watch app. In addition to the Swift 2.0 code for watchOS, I also wrote some Javascript in order to interface between the Cordova app on which the Natural Cycles iPhone app is based and my native Apple Watch code. The watch is quite limited in terms of UI customisation and functionality and this app stretched the boundaries of both but the end result works incredibly well.</p>

			<h3>Chipp'd</h3>
			<p>Share secrets via unique QR code based gifts</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-app.jpg" width="940" height="534" alt="Chipp'd for iPhone">
		<p>I worked on <a href="http://chippd.com/">Chipp'd</a> towards the end of 2015 in order to build them a version 2.0 of their app within a very agressive timescale. Chipp'd is an app that works with real world products (available at <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d">John Lewis</a>) to let you share secrets or private messages with your friends. You simply scan the QR code on the gift, create your secret (with video, audio, photos, and text), and send the gift; your friend will then be able to see that secret when they scan it with the app or any other QR scanner. It is also possible to share secrets for free using the app via auto-generated URLs that can be sent via email or SMS.</p>
		<p>I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the CTO of Chipp'd to integrate their existing API into the product. Everything was written in Swift 2.0 and used AutoLayout for flexible layouts on all iPhone screen sizes. I'm particularly proud of the QR scanner which I custom built when it transpired that the products that had been printed and shipped to distributors were too light for a conventional QR scanner to detect; I used GPUImage to manipulate the live video feed with multiple filters per second in order to quickly scan at different brightnesses and solve the problem.</p>

		<p>Brapp is a free and easy way to create and discover exciting musical collaborations all over the world. Producers can share their beats allowing anyone to make mini music videos right on their phone complete with video filters and custom audio balancing.</p>
		<p>I worked with Brapp throughout 2015 as the sole iOS developer working closely with the app creator and his API developer. I was able to write the app in Swift and use AutoLayout to make sure everything scales beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone. In addition, I made use of GPUImage for the custom video filters and a whole load of low-level audio APIs to get the audio balance just right as well as real time waveforms and switching between external microphones. The design went through a number of iterations, each better than the last, and I was able to use my extensive UX knowledge to help shape the end result.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://twothirdswater.co.uk">Two Thirds Water</a> during Spring 2015 to build a new version of the Great British Bee Count app for their client <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/page/join-great-british-bee-count-today">Friends of the Earth</a>. I built the app from scratch to make use of the Swift language and quickly use features such as AutoLayout to scale their pixel-perfect designs to the various sizes of iPhone. The app allows you to count bees in your local area - these counts are stored locally so that they can be performed offline with synchornisation happening automatically when a network connection appears.</p>
		<p>The Great British Bee Count is taking place from 1st May until 31st May 2015.</p>

		<p>I worked with Loly at the end of 2014 to update their iPhone app to fix performance issues, improve usability, and add an iOS 8 keyboard. The app was written from the ground up with Swift, uses AutoLayout to render beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone, has iCloud syncing of favourites, and includes an incredibly technically complex iOS 8 keyboard extension. In addition, I built an online admin system so that the packs could be updated, added, and re-ordered remotely without going through the App Store review process. This is all powered by an innovative patch system I developed which allows for small delta updates to minimise bandwidth costs.</p>

		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/glenfiddich-app.jpg" width="940" height="627" alt="Glenfiddich for iPad">
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.verb.digital">Verb Digital</a> in spring 2015 as the sole iOS developer to develop a unique app for Glenfiddich. The app is part of a large installation to showcase a limited edition of Glenfiddich which is available exclusively at Changhi Airport. The single cask that has been selected by Glenfiddich is on display within a specially constructed glass chamber that showcases the weather and atmospheric conditions of the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. The iPad app allows for customers to see the current conditions in Dufftown including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and the time. This is paired with multiple sound effects which match with the weather conditions. The app also talks with a control PC via a direct socket connection over WiFi in order to control the weather effects within the chamber simulating morning fog, wind, and even rain!</p>
		<p>The app is written entirely in Swift 1.2 and the iPad is locked down with Guided Access to prevent customers accessing anything else. You can see the app at the Glenfiddich Residence store in Changhi Airport for the duration of 2015.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://monterosa.co.uk/">Monterosa Productions</a> in spring 2013 as the sole iOS developer to produce the Horse Tracker app for Channel 4. The app uses some innovative technology in order to provide a groundbreaking second screen experience on iPhone and iPad. Each horse within the 3 days of racing at Aintree is fitted with a tracker in order to provide their exact position within their race along with speed and distance data. This is displayed in the app to help you find your horse but the really clever piece is that the app listens to the TV broadcast in order to timesync you perfectly - this is important as the terrestrial broadcast can have up to a 20 second difference depending on where in the country you are and what service you use.</p>
		<p>The app was highly successful with 165,000 unique users during the Grand National whilst reaching <strong>#1 on the App Store</strong>.</p>

			<h3>IslandBreak</h3>
			<p>A smart travel guide for The Bahamas</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with the founder of IslandBreak during Spring 2014 as their only developer. The app was interesting to work on due to the need for a completely offline experience. This wasn’t limited to just the points of interest and itineraries (which feature a huge amount of beautiful high-resolution photos) but also the map; this was a requirement so that tourists don’t have to use their data plans, particularly in an area which has very poor mobile reception. Getting a full map of the islands complete with multiple zoom levels and the experience you expect on iOS was difficult, but works really well. In addition, I built an online CMS in PHP so that the app content can be updated remotely without going through the App Store approval process.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://thelatenightsalon.co.uk/">The Late Night Salon</a> in autumn 2013 as the only iOS and PHP developer to produce the Meat Map London app. The app allows customers to find interesting 'meateries' in London and displays lots of metadata such as contact numbers, opening hours, and rich imagery. In addition to the application (which makes use to iCloud for syncing favorites), I built the online CMS and API which powers the app and allows for fast delta updates when new content is added by the production team.</p>
		<p>The app was designed for iOS 7 but has been retro-fitted so that it can also run on iOS 6 with a similar design. There is iCloud syncing functionality, use of UIDynamics, and integration with the built-in Facebook and Twitter services.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.portalentertainment.co.uk">Portal Entertainment</a> throughout the first half of 2013 to build the original prototypes and game elements for their unique horror experience. This included using the camera and timezone detection in order to determine the darkness of a room, interactive glyph recognition from touch gestures, AI for a self writing journal, and advanced video rendering techniques to overlay dynamic content and display the players home within the experience. In addition, I wrote several APIs to provide more advanced functionality (such as determing sunrise and sundown at player location) and worked with <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> in order to add real phone numbers that could be called and enabled the game to phone the player. Finally, I built several companion websites that went with the experience.</p>
