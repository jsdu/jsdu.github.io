			<h3>WeLink</h3>
			<p>Social media app for meeting strangers</p>
		</header>
		<p>WeLink is an iOS App made during Hack the North 2015. I led a team of four to design and create this app in 48 hours. The purpose of this app is to connect people with others around them. Users provide their interest and hobbies when they sign up, creating an online public profile that other WeLink users will see. Users are able to message and send selfies to each other and will gain points based on how "happy" they were. I used Cocoa Pods to integrate the Facebook API for secure logins. I used <a id="link" href="https://indico.io">Indico's</a> REST API to analyze the emotions of the selfies taken. </p>

			<h3>Safe.ly</h3>
			<p>Safe Driving, No Sleepy Driving</p>
		</header>
		<p>Safe.ly is an Android app made during Wearhacks Montreal. Safe.ly connects to a Muse headset and is used by a drive to analyzes their brain waves. Safe.ly sends notifications whenever the user starts to fall asleep. We used Muse's Api to analyze head movement and brain waves. We then send notifications at the optimal time to alert the driver. We placed top 8 overall and received the best hack on the Muse. As a result we received a free Muse Headset to hack on. BCI Montreal wrote an article about this hackathon where our app was featured which you can find <a id="link" href="http://bcimontreal.org/bci-hackathon/">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Loblawfy</h3>
			<p>Replace all pictures with Loblaw-related pictures</p>
		</header>
		<p>Loblawfy is a Chrome extension made during Loblaw's hackathon. I had no prior experience with Javascript so building this extension helped me understand Javascript. Loblawfy replaces all images with pictures related to Loblaws. It also replaces key words such as 'Walmart', or 'Sobeys' with 'Loblaws'. It also changes any link that points to Walmart, with a link that goes to the homepage of Loblaws. Finally, a beautiful animated background of Loblaws runs in the background. This chrome extension is for the truly dedicated Loblaws employee, who wishes to show their love and dedication of Loblaws in their browser. </p>
